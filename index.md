Hi, my name is Dan. I'm a 20 year old programmer and fighting game enthusiast from Chicago, currently doing his Bachelors in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.<br>
I chose the name "TheLettuceClub" because I thought it sounded funny as my friends were making jokes about a club that eat a whole head of lettuce.

I can't do that, much as I'd want to, but I have done many other wonderful things. Here's a quick list:
* Reverse-engineered and created state-exporting mods for four of my favorite fighting games. ([Guilty Gear Strive](https://github.com/TheLettuceClub/StriveSAMMI-Release) and [Accent Core](https://github.com/TheLettuceClub/GGXXACPR_Framework), [BlazBlue: Central Fiction](https://github.com/TheLettuceClub/BBCF-Sammi) and [Under Night In-Birth 2](https://github.com/TheLettuceClub/UNI2xSAMMI-Release))
    * This involved working with industry-standard tools like Ghidra and Cheat Engine to find the things I wanted.
* Written hundreds of smaller programs in many languages (C/C++, Rust, Java, Python, C#, Lua, etc) that accomplish various useful tasks.
    * One summer, I decided to learn the C++ Windows API, which went pretty well.
    * I started learning Rust via their documentation, but got sidetracked.
* Became the president of WPI's Fighting Game Club, leading the club to have it's first official budget and tournament with a prize pool.
* Survived (at time of writing) nearly two years of college.
